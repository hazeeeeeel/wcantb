![Project Screenshot](src/screenshot2.png)

### Overview
This is a presentation of my own conflicting thoughts about **consumer culture** and **personal identity**.

I have had this debate going on in my head for years. On the one side is my desire to attain or pretend **"a better self"** through online shopping; on the other is my sanity that raises **doubts against consumerism**, trending aesthetics and influencer culture.

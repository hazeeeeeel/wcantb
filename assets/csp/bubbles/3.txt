I have heard famous graphic designers and people who work in the advertising industry talk about “shopping as a kind of market research” or “cultivate your taste”, etc. Maybe it sounds fair for someone like a shoe maker to collect shoes, but a graphic designer can buy so many expensive useless things that you can only say, “That’s how creative people are”.

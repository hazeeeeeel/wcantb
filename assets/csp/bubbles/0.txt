When I share things on social media platforms, it feels very different from writing a blog post or facebook post ten years ago. When I post pictures on instagram, it often takes me 30 minutes to arrange the photos and edit the caption. After hitting “send”, I will spend the next 3 hours with the thought of “why does no one like my post” looming in my head.

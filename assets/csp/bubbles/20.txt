In Consuming Life (2007), Bauman writes extensively on the subject of consumerism and its effects on social life. He argues that in liquid modernity, people no longer form deep, lasting relationships based on common values or shared experiences. Instead, they turn to consumer goods as a means of expressing identity and maintaining a sense of connection, albeit superficial. We consume not just for practical reasons, but because it helps us define ourselves in the eyes of others, and provides a temporary sense of belonging in a fragmented society. However, if we are ourselves aware of this, we can proactively make use of the purchase decisions we make. Take those additional values and potential connections into account, and evaluate if they are worth it.

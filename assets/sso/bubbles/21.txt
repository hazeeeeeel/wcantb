In Jean Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality, things areÂ consumed for their surface value, and their deeper meanings are lost in the sea of images and simulations. For example, in the glamorous music videos of pop songs about female power, we often see loads of edgy looks, well-curated sets, mind-blowing editing skills and expensive props, which bombards our senses and mind. The connection between these images and the value it claims to represent is vague.

Jean Baudrillard, The Gulf War Did Not Take Place (1995). In this work, Baudrillard explores how media, particularly television and other forms of mass communication, shape public perception of reality. He argues that the proliferation of information in modern society does not lead to greater understanding, but instead results in a hyperreal world where meaning is obscured or diluted.

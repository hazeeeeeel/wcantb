In his 1981 work Simulacra and Simulation, Baudrillard outlines how reality is increasingly replaced by symbols, signs, and images. These images no longer reflect an underlying reality but have become realities in themselves. Examples include everything from advertisements to media images and brand identities, which shape and dictate our perception of reality.

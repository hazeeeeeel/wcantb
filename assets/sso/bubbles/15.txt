Angela McRobbie, Be Creative: Making a Living in the New Culture Industries (2016). In her book, McRobbie critically examines the transformation of the creative industries and how the notion of “creativity” has been commodified in contemporary society. She explores how individuals, particularly those working in creative sectors like design, media, and the arts, are encouraged to frame their work as a personal passion or calling while simultaneously navigating the uncertainties of freelance, gig, or portfolio-based labor. What once began as a genuine desire for fulfilling and meaningful work has, in McRobbie’s analysis, been transformed into a series of "techniques" that individuals must learn in order to succeed in the modern creative economy. These techniques include skills such as self-marketing, personal branding, networking, and constantly adapting to the fluctuating demands of the industry.

Guy Debord, The Society of the SpectacleÂ (1967). In this influential text, Debord critiques the way in which modern society has become dominated by images and representations, which he refers to as the "spectacle." Debord's central thesis is: that society has shifted from an era of direct interaction and experience to one where people relate to the world primarily through the consumption of images, thereby diminishing the value of the real world itself.

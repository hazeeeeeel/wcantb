“That which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art.” Walter Benjamin argued in "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1935) that with the rise of technologies like photography and film, art became something that could be mass-produced, reproduced, and distributed widely. Benjamin explains that the act of reproducing art changes its perception and experience. When something is reproduced, it loses its singularity and, by extension, its authenticity. No longer is the artwork tied to its unique creation; it becomes a mere object for consumption and possession.

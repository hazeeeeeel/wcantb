Guy Debord, Society of the Spectacle (1967). In Debord’s view, the spectacle commodifies not only products but desires, emotions, and even experiences: "The spectacle is the materialization of the abstract." In a world dominated by the spectacle, even the deepest human experiences and emotions are commodified. Love, happiness, success, and fulfillment are sold as lifestyle products—they become brands that can be bought, consumed, and marketed. People are encouraged to pursue these idealized versions of life, not through authentic experience, but through the purchase of commodities that promise to deliver these ideals.
